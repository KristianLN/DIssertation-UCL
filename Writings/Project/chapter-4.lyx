\begin_layout Standard
Having outlined the methodology of the study, it is time to explore the
 environment, address the challenges and solve the environment.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When is the environment solved? The environment is solved when the agent
 can cope with the different type of challenges that the environment processes.
 As mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-environment"

, the environment of this study processes four main challenges; difficult
 areas, static obstacles, crowded areas and dynamic obstacles.

The Look of Learning

\begin_layout Standard
Learning can be expressed in many ways 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, however, the most intuitive statistics is the ACR and the ALE, examples
 are seen from figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ACR-and-ALE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ACR curve indicates how well the agent performs, and it is expected
 to converge towards the upper bound of the reward, within a single episode,
 doing learning.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The ALE should converge to the minimum number of steps needed to obtain
 the reward.
 If a small negative reward is provided at each step, the ALE and ACR develop
 almost inversely, because the number of steps bounds the maximum obtainable
 reward.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The speed of which the convergence takes place is a result of the complexity
 of the environment and the degree of assistance provided to the agent,
 as will be clear doing this section.

 are ideals, and far from trivial to obtain with the slightest degree of
 complexity present.
 The road to meaningful learning requires careful design of the aid provided
 to the agent to ensure generalisation and so providing the agent with the
 ability to handle unseen and challenging environments.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

The blue curves are obtained from the environment from figure

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Learning can take place in complex environments, seen from the increasing
 blue ACR, but it is not guaranteed to be meaningful or stable.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An ACR-curve fluctuating around zero indicates that the actions of the agent
 is dominated by random actions.
 The purpose of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ACR-and-ALE"

\end_inset

 is to motivate the need for aids, to constitute meaningful and sustainable
 learning with the ability to generalise to unseen environments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning can be sensitive to the initialisation of the environment, especially
 if avoidable objects are added randomly.
 However, over time, the policy does converge to the optimal policy, see

Learning to Learn
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the complexity of environment, it is sometimes necessary to
 aid the learning process of an agent.
 Guiding the agent doing the learning process is necessary if the complexity
 of the environment fosters a sub-optimal policy, because it is too difficult
 to learn the optimal policy.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A brief example on this; Imagine an environment consisting of static obstacles
 and pedestrians.
 If the probability of colliding with a pedestrian is too high, because
 the pedestrian density of the environment is high, it could be suboptimal
 for the agent to bump into a static obstacle as fast as possible.
 The high collision-probability implies a low locating-target-probability,
 which implies the need for a lot of steps to locate the target.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The suboptimal policy would minimise the number of steps taken, by bumping
 into the wall as fast a possible, receiving the associated penalisation,
 which would seem inevitable for the agent anyway, given the high collision-prob
ability.

Curriculum Learning

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step towards improving learning is to introduce a curriculum,
 for the agent to learn from, to gradually add complexity to the environment,
 as the agent learn to cope with novel challenges.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The use of CL for machine learning algorithms was formalised by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bengio:2009:CL:1553374.1553380"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and they specifically studied the use of CL on deep nets, with their experimen
ts showing significant improvements in terms of generalisation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1804-00168"

\end_inset

 used CL successfully for navigation using DRL, and reported great generalisatio
n properties of their work.
 How to optimally design a curriculum is almost a study worth itself, and
 the curriculum used here is designed, such that it directly addresses three
 of the four main challenges equally, namely the static obstacles, the crowded
 areas and the dynamic obstacles.
 Specifying curriculums in Unity is done in a json file, seen in figure

 The dictionary contains at least one variable for each of the three types
 of obstacles, along with an option to specify the number of training areas,
 allowing for parallelisation of the training.
 The latter is described in more detail in section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curriculum is designed such that the obstacles are introduced relative
 to their degree of complexity.
 The first challenge is the static obstacles, then the semi-static crowded
 areas and finally the dynamic pedestrians.
 Each type of obstacle is introduced over three lessons, and the same threshold
 is required.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The threshold should be set with two variables of the environment in mind,
 namely the AEL and the
\shape italic
 step penalty
\shape default
 (SP), as well as the value of the 
\shape italic
minimum number of episodes
\shape default
 (MNE).
 The AEL and SP form an upper bound on the level of obtainable ACR, and
 the relationship between the ACR and the threshold gets stronger the higher
 the value of MNE.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the positive reward is 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

, the AEL is 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

 and SP is 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.0005$
\end_inset

, then the upper bound of the ACR is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-(200\cdot-0.0005)=0.9$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Assuming the SP is the only penalty received.
\end_layout

 Furthermore, if one training run consist of 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

 episodes, and the MNE is chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

, then the threshold is equivalent to ACR.
 Setting the threshold and MNE too high implies no progress and setting
 them too low can result in unstable progress.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Signal smoothing can be enabled to increase the robustness of the signal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common misconception when working with reinforcement learning is the amount
 of data needed to sustain meaningful learning, the planning fallacy as
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rlblogpost"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Which means that the MNE and the threshold should be chosen at a level,
 which ensures stable learning which generalises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CL is a necessity in this study, for the four different robotic agents to
 sustain any meaningful learning, within a reasonable time.
 The following section outlines the performance of each of the four agents,
 using nothing but CL.

\begin_layout Standard
This section outlines the first set of results obtained on all four agents,
 which serves as a basis for evaluating the effect of the sections to come.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The agents are evaluated by their ability to deal with the challenges provided
 by the CL, as well as their ability to locate targets in difficult areas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate how the agents‚Äô deal with the challenges presented by the CL,
 learning rates are estimated and compared.
 The learning rates are estimated by fitting a linear regression model to
 each subsection, made up by a single lesson, of the data.
 The use of a linear regression model is justified by examining each subsection,
 which approximately follows a linear curve, as a result of the chosen threshold
 and minimum lesson length.
 An example is shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

To evaluate how the agents deals with the difficult areas, it is necessary
 to exact data from the simulation model.
 For each episode, it is recorded if the target was in a difficult area
 and whether it was reached.
 The moving share of reached targets in difficult areas, over the past 500
 episodes, are compared for each of the agents.

The motivation of invoking a maximum number of steps for the agent to take,
 is that above a certain threshold, destructive paths is too likely to occur.
 Destructive paths occur because of too much complexity, which implies that
 unwounded behaviour becomes optimal at time.

\begin_layout Standard
An example of this is that the agent runs in circles, because the target
 is located in area which is either associated with too high a probability

 The size of step penalty implies running in circles is more attractive

The first important finding is, that the restricted agent (red) reaches
 targets in the difficult areas continuously throughout training.

 reveals an interesting observation, namely that the efficiency, in terms
 of episodes with TLDA resulting in the target being reached, does not appear
 to differ, taking the differences in TLDA-shares into consideration.
 However, the steps needed to reach the target is on average

 lower for the bounded agent, which results in better performance.

Bounding the steps of the agent results in the agent learning the environment

The main objective of parallelisation is to reduce training time, and where
 training of deep nets with hundreds of millions of weights and billions

Part of these advances comes from novel algorithms, which benefit from paralleli

 These novel algorithms incorporate experience of the agent to update the
 function approximation in question, thereby reducing the amount of data

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running concurrent training environments, externally as well as internally,
 fills the same experience buffer with prior observations.
 The usual benefit is that training accelerate, because the share of favourable
 prior observations increases faster with more agents to harvest.
 However, it can go the other way, if the environment contains too much
 complexity at the time being.
 Furthermore, if nothing prevents the agents from wandering around to infinity,
 a bad spiral unfolds.
 This spiral is powered by two events; firstly, the agents never benefit
 from sharing experience because they rarely finish an episode.
 Secondly, the shared experience is low quality because of the wandering.
 In this way, sharing becomes a burden.
 This is referred to as the feedback-loop-effect by

An interesting observation is that agent 1, having only sensor observations
 available, seems to deal with the crowded areas most efficiently, based
 on the learning rate and time spent in those lessons.
 Agent 1 outperforms all agents having information about nearby crowded
 areas available, closely followed by agent 4.

 in dealing with the uncertainty, which takes effect with the introduction
 of the crowded areas.
 Another interesting observation is that agent 2 and 4 deals most efficiently

 roughly the same level, perhaps with exception of agent 4.
 Agent 4 lies 5-10 percentage points below the other agents, with no sign
 of demising variance.
 Agent 1,2 and 3 converge to the same level as seen under certainty.
 The results have now been outlined, and it is now time to discuss what
 is witnessed and the potential implications, as long with the limitations
