\begin_layout Standard
Having outlined the methodology of the study, it is time to explore the
 environment, address the challenges and hopefully solve the environment.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When is the environment solved? The environment is solved when the agent
 can cope with the different type of challenges that the environment processes.
 As mentioned in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-environment"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the environment of this study processes four main challenges; difficult
 areas, static obstacles, crowded areas and dynamic obstacles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The look of learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Learning can be expressed in many ways 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "TBOTU"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, however, the most intuitive statistics is the ACR and the ALE, examples
 are seen from figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ACR-and-ALE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ACR is expected to converge to the maximum obtainable level of reward
 within a single episode, when learning has taken place and the agent has
 solved the environment.
 The ALE should converge to the minimum number of steps needed to obtain
 the reward.
 If a small negative reward is provided at each step, the ALE and ACR develop
 almost inversely, because the number of steps bound the maximum obtainable
 reward.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The speed of which the convergence takes place is a result of the complexity
 of the environment and the degree of assistance provided to the agent,
 as will be clear doing this section.

 are ideals, and far from trivial to obtain with the slightest degree of
 complexity present.
 The road to meaningful learning requires careful design of the aid provided
 to the agent to ensure generalisation and so providing the agent with the
 ability to handle unseen and challenging environments.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

The blue curves are obtained from the environment from figure

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Learning can take place in complex environments, seen from the increasing
 blue ACR, but it is not guaranteed to be meaningful or stable.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An ACR-curve fluctuating around zero indicates that the actions of the agent
 is dominated by random actions.
 It is not possible to say whether the actions of the agent would continue
 to be random, or if more learning would take place over time.

 purpose of figure

\end_inset

 is to motivate the need for aids, to constitute meaningful and sustainable
 learning with the ability to generalise to unseen environments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final note is that learning can be sensitive to the initialisation of
 the environment, especially if avoidable objects are added randomly.
 However, over time, the policy does converge to the optimal policy, see

Learning to learn

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the environment, it is sometimes necessary to aid the learning
 process of an agent, as a result of what model-free RL basically are –
 a function mapping, often high-dimensional, from states to actions.
 In English, that means that too complex states can result in odd behaviour,
 if the quality of the function mapping is too poor at the time being.
 This section covers different ways to minimise the occurrence of destructive
 behaviour, by using aids to develop a high-quality function mapping, to
 facilitate meaningful learning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Curriculum Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step towards improving learning is to introduce a curriculum,
 for the agent to learn from, to gradually add complexity to the environment,
 as the agent learn to cope with novel challenges.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The use of CL for machine learning algorithms was formalised by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bengio:2009:CL:1553374.1553380"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and they specifically studied the use of CL on deep nets, with their experimen
ts showing significant improvements in terms of generalisation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1804-00168"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used CL successfully for navigation using DRL, and reported great generalisatio
n properties of their work.
 How to optimally design a curriculum is almost a study worth itself, and
 the curriculum used here is designed, such that it directly addresses three
 of the four main challenges equally, namely the static obstacles, the crowded
 areas and the dynamic obstacles.
 Specifying curriculums in Unity is done in a json file, seen in figure

 The dictionary contains at least one variable for each of the three types
 of obstacles, along with an option to specify the number of training areas,
 allowing for parallelisation of the training.
 The latter is described in more detail in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curriculum is designed such that the obstacles are introduced relative
 to their degree of complexity.
 The first challenge is the static obstacles, then the semi-static crowded
 areas and finally the dynamic pedestrians.
 Each type of obstacle is introduced over three lessons, and the same threshold
 is required.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The threshold should be set with two variables of the environment in mind,
 namely the AEL and the
\shape italic
 step penalty
\shape default
 (SP), as well as the value of the 
\shape italic
minimum number of episodes
\shape default
 (MNE).
 The AEL and SP form an upper bound on the level of obtainable ACR, and
 the relationship between the ACR and the threshold gets stronger the higher
 the value of MNE.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the positive reward is 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

, the AEL is 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

 and SP is 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.0005$
\end_inset

, then the upper bound of the ACR is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-(200\cdot-0.0005)=0.9$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Assuming the SP is the only penalty received.
\end_layout

 Furthermore, if one training run consist of 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

 episodes, and the MNE is chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $200$
\end_inset

, then the threshold is equivalent to ACR.
 Setting the threshold and MNE too high implies no progress and setting
 them too low can result in unstable progress.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Signal smoothing can be enabled to increase the robustness of the signal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common misconception when working with reinforcement learning is the amount
 of data needed to sustain meaningful learning, the planning fallacy as
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rlblogpost"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Which means that the MNE and the threshold should be chosen at a level,
 which ensures stable learning which generalises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CL is a necessity in this study, for the four different robotic agents to
 sustain any meaningful learning, within a reasonable time.
 The following section outlines the performance of each of the four agents,
 using just CL.

 However, this set the stage for investigating the effect of different aids

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Maximum Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation of invoking a maximum number of steps for the agent to take,
 is that above a certain threshold, destructive paths is too likely to occur.
 Destructive paths occur because of too much complexity, which implies that
 unwounded behaviour becomes optimal at time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of this is that the agent runs in circles, because the target
 is located in area which is either associated with too high a probability
 of colliding with obstacles or unexplored, and so uncertain, and because
 of the size of step penalty, that implies running in circles is more attractive
 at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, the threshold should be chosen such that it doesn’t circumvents the
 agent for moving around the entire environment.

The first important finding is, that the restricted agent (red) reaches
 targets in the difficult areas continuously throughout training.
 This indicates that restricting the number of steps to

 does not prevent the agent for exploring even the toughest parts of the
 environment.

 reveals an interesting observation, namely that the efficiency, in terms
 of episodes with TLDA resulting in the target being reached, does not appear
 to differ, taking the differences in TLDA-shares into consideration.
 However, the steps needed to reach the target is on average 
\begin_inset Formula $15\%$

 lower for the bounded agent, which results in better performance.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

Bounding the steps of the agent appears to result in the agent learning
 the environment quicker, and taking smarter actions, which over the longer
 run could materialise in overall improved efficiency because the quality

, to cope with the amount of data needed, and manipulating the training
 time, to obtain significant results.
 The main objective of parallelisation is to reduce training time, and where
 training of deep nets with hundreds of millions of weights and billions
 of connections between units took weeks two years ago, advances in parallelisat
ion have reduced training time to a few hours

\begin_inset Newline newline

Part of these advances in parallelisation comes from novel algorithms, which
 benefit from parallelisation other than reduced training time.
 These novel algorithms incorporate experience of the agent to update the
 function approximation in question, thereby reducing the amount of data
 needed, and this is exactly what PPO does.

Parallelisation, at least in Unity, works by running concurrent training
 environments, either internally or externally.
 External refers to running multiple applications of the same environment,
 often used when training on GPU’s via cloud computing.
 Internal refers to having multiple environments, with the agents being
 linked to the same brain, within one application, see figure

\begin_layout Standard
Running concurrent training environments, externally as well as internally,
 fills the same experience buffer with prior observations.
 The usual benefit is that training accelerate, because the share of favourable
 prior observations increases faster with more agents to harvest.
 However, it can of cause go the other way, if the environment contains
 too much complexity at the time being.
 Furthermore, if nothing prevents the agents from wandering around to infinity,
 a bad spiral unfolds.
 This spiral is powered by two events; firstly, the agents never benefit
 from sharing experience because they rarely finish an episode.
 Secondly, the shared experience is low quality of the wandering.
 In this way, sharing becomes a burden.
 This is referred to as the feedback-loop-effect by
